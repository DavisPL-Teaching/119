## Monday, October 27

Reminders:

- OH after class today, Friday 11am

Plan for today:

I am trying a slightly new format for the lecture notes by dividing them into
parts, roughly one per class period.
For today, see `parts/1-motivation.py` and `parts/2-definitions.py`

Plan:

- Finish small activity on RAM and Pandas + poll

- Example pipeline and running it with parallel workers

- Key definitions: parallel/concurrent/distributed distinction

Questions?
