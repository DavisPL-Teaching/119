Plan for today:

I am trying a slightly new format for the lecture notes by dividing them into
parts, roughly one per class period.
For today, see `parts/1-motivation.py` and `parts/2-definitions.py`

Plan:

- Finish small activity on RAM and Pandas + poll

- Example pipeline and running it with parallel workers

- Key definitions: parallel/concurrent/distributed distinction

Questions?

- HW1 grading underway; please stay tuned for a Piazza post when official grades are released.

- I have sorted the rest of the lecture material into parts

Plan:

- Finish parallel/concurrent/distributed distinction (`2-parallelism.py`)

- Poll

- Concurrency.
