Sep 24:
Tools required and characteristics and needs of your application will change drastically with the size of the dataset.

Sep 26:
N/A

Sep 29:
1) One possible answer: input file does not exist
2) No, because the maximum row of a dataset is not always unique.

Oct 3:
All except B ("Will speed up the development of a one-off script")

Oct 6:
1) Edges from:
read -> max, min, and avg
max, min, and avg -> print
max, min, and avg -> save

2) read -> print or read -> save (give a specific example)

Oct 8:
True, False, False.

Oct 10:
1) Throughput = 1,000 records/hour assuming the full pipeline is measured from 9am to 9pm.
2) 30 minutes on average
3) From the perspective of the patient (individual row level): uniformly distributed between 0min and 60min delay.

Oct 13:
1) hrs, ms, s, ns
2) F F F T T F

Oct 15:
Correct answers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 (all except 6: "To load & use pandas to calculate the max and average of a DataFrame")

1, 2: no one correct answer, most answers were clustered 8 GB or 16GB
3: Pandas requires 5-10x the amount of RAM as your dataset, so for 16GB you should have gotten 1.6GB to 3.2GB for the lagest dataset you can handle.

Oct 29:
1. Parallel
2. Parallel + Concurrent
3. Parallel + Concurrent
4. Concurrent + Distributed
5. Parallel + Distributed
6. Parallel + Concurrent + Distributed

1. Intended answer was between 0 and 200;
to be fully precise, the correct answer should be any value between 2 and 200 (inclusive).

2. ABDEFG
   Concurrency, Parallelism, Contention, Race Condition, Data Race -
   and Spooky Halloween Vibes, because data races are scary!! :-)
